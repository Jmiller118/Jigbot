# Jigbot
Jigbot is an undergraduate research project for a robot to build a jigsaw puzzle.

This project uses Python, a Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, and a PID Controller. At the end of 
the project, the robot was capable of moving in a square looking up and down a circles. 
This code was developed by me and some tutorials were modified from examples online. The 
PID Controller code was developed by my undergraduate advisor, Dr. John Nicholson.
